#Functions

print("How you doing?")

#Input work system

print(input("What is your name? "))

#Variable

name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, name")
#Not right
#Another try

name = input("What is your name? ")
print("hello, ")
print(name)

#Not entirely true but correct!
#In this part I should teach kids what is comments aka pseudocode for knowing what my code does every time we want to take look at our lines of code
#Another solution
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("hello,"+name)
#Better solution
print
